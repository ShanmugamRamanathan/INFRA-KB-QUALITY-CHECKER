Title: SCOM Heartbeat Failure
If a SCOM agent stops sending heartbeat messages, first check if the server is online and reachable over the network.
Verify that you can ping the server and that DNS name resolution works correctly.
Then confirm that the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (Health Service) is running and restart it if required using services.msc or PowerShell.
If the issue persists, check if the agent certificate or RunAs account has changed or expired.

[DOC2]
Title: SCOM Agent Greyed Out
When an agent appears greyed out in the SCOM console, it usually indicates a communication problem.
Check the OperationsManager event log on the agent for connectivity or authentication errors.
Ensure that firewalls allow communication between the agent and the management server on the required ports (TCP 5723 by default).
If needed, run the SCOM Agent Repair from the console or reinstall the agent.

[DOC3]
Title: SCCM Client Not Reporting
If an SCCM client is not reporting inventory or software deployment status, first confirm that the SCCM client is installed and visible in the console.
Check that the SMS Agent Host (CcmExec) service is running on the client.
Verify that the client can reach the Management Point and Distribution Point over HTTP or HTTPS.
Review LocationServices.log and ClientLocation.log on the client for site assignment and MP communication issues.

[DOC4]
Title: SCCM Application Deployment Failed
When an application deployment fails in SCCM, start by checking AppEnforce.log on the client for the exact error code and command line used.
Confirm that the content is available on the Distribution Point and that the client has network access to it.
Validate that the detection method is correct; a wrong detection rule can mark a successful install as failed.
Also verify that the user or device is in the correct collection targeted by the deployment.

[DOC5]
Title: SCOM Disk Space Alert
For low disk space alerts in SCOM, log on to the affected server and review free space on all volumes using Disk Management or PowerShell.
Clean temporary files, old log files, and unnecessary installers.
If application logs are consuming space, consider redirecting them to another volume or implementing log rotation.
If alerts are too frequent for normal usage, adjust the SCOM monitor threshold to a more appropriate value.

[DOC6]
Title: Windows Service Not Running
If a monitored Windows service is reported as stopped, first try to start the service manually and note any error messages.
Check the System and Application event logs for related errors or crashes around the time the service stopped.
Verify that the service account password is correct and not locked out.
If the service keeps stopping, enable service recovery options to restart it automatically and investigate underlying application issues.

[DOC7]
Title: SCOM Management Server Health
When a SCOM management server is unhealthy, check the OperationsManager and System event logs for database or connectivity issues.
Ensure that the Data Access Service and SDK Service are running.
Verify that the management server can connect to the Operations database and Data Warehouse.
If grooming or maintenance jobs are failing, the database might require indexing or space cleanup.

[DOC8]
Title: SCCM Software Update Scan Issues
If clients are not receiving software updates, review WUAHandler.log and ScanAgent.log on the client.
Ensure that the Software Update Point (SUP) is healthy and synchronized with WSUS.
Confirm that the client can reach the SUP URL and that the correct WSUS/SUP is assigned in client settings.
Sometimes resetting the Windows Update components on the client can resolve scanning problems.

[DOC9]
Title: SCOM RunAs Account Problems
When monitors or rules fail due to RunAs account issues, verify that the RunAs account is still valid and not locked out or expired.
Check RunAs profile associations to ensure they are targeted to the correct servers.
Avoid using personal user accounts as RunAs accounts; instead, use dedicated service accounts with least privilege.
Update passwords in SCOM whenever the underlying Active Directory account password changes.

Title: General Windows Performance Troubleshooting
For general Windows performance issues, start with Task Manager or Resource Monitor to identify high CPU, memory, or disk usage processes.
Check for scheduled tasks, antivirus scans, or backup jobs running during peak hours.
Review System and Application event logs for hardware errors, disk warnings, or driver problems.
Consider collecting a PerfMon data collector set to analyze sustained performance bottlenecks.
